Costs can start at just a few thousand dollars and stretch to over a million for the most advanced systems. Why the big range? Because not all chatbots are created equal. Some are like friendly receptionists answering FAQs. Others are like experienced sales reps or technical support pros who understand complex questions, access your internal systems, and respond in real time with personalized insights.So the real question isn't just "How much does it cost?"‚Äîit's "What kind of AI assistant do you want, and what do you want it to do for you?"## üîç Now Get Specific: A Technical & Strategic Analysis### üí∞ Cost Spectrum: From Entry-Level to EnterpriseThe cost of a custom chatbot depends on its complexity and scope:Chatbot Type
