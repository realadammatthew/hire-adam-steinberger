<p>When most people hear "AI," they imagine a talking robot, a supercomputer plotting world domination, or maybe just Siri getting their coffee order wrong. But in reality, <strong>AI isn't one single thing</strong> ‚Äî it's a whole spectrum of systems with different abilities, goals, and levels of intelligence.</p>

            <p>To really understand where AI is <em>now</em> (and where it's going), it helps to know the main "types" of AI. Don't worry ‚Äî we'll keep things simple, then dive deeper for those who want the technical meat.</p>

            <h2 id="short-version" className="fw-bold section-headline-blue">üß† The Short Version: Two Big Buckets of AI</h2>
            
            <p>Think of AI like sports. There are many types of athletes ‚Äî sprinters, swimmers, basketball players ‚Äî but we can broadly sort them into two groups: <strong>specialists</strong> and <strong>generalists</strong>.</p>
            
            <p>AI works the same way.</p>

            <h3 className="fw-bold section-headline-gold">1. <strong>Narrow AI</strong> (what we have today)</h3>
            
            <p>These are AI systems trained to do <strong>one specific thing very well</strong> ‚Äî like recognizing faces, recommending movies, answering questions, or driving a car.</p>
            
            <p>Examples:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Siri and Alexa</li>
              <li>Chatbots on websites</li>
              <li>Self-driving features in cars</li>
              <li>Netflix recommendations</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="fw-bold section-headline-gold">2. <strong>General AI</strong> (what we don't have yet)</h3>
            
            <p>This is the stuff of sci-fi: machines that can learn <em>anything</em>, solve <em>any</em> problem, and reason like a human across multiple fields.</p>
            
            <p>We're not there yet ‚Äî and we're not even close. General AI is still a research dream, not a reality.</p>

            <h2 id="conversational-ai" className="fw-bold section-headline-green">üó£Ô∏è A Special Case: Conversational AI</h2>
            
            <p>You're probably already talking to Narrow AI without realizing it ‚Äî through <strong>Conversational AI</strong>.</p>
            
            <p>These are AI systems built specifically to understand and generate natural language. In other words, they talk.</p>
            
            <p>Chatbots, virtual assistants, customer service bots ‚Äî they're all forms of Conversational AI. And when done well, they can answer questions, guide users, and even handle sales or support ‚Äî without sounding like a robot from 1995.</p>

            <h2 id="full-breakdown" className="fw-bold section-headline-blue">üîç Zooming In: The Full Breakdown</h2>
            
            <p>Now that we've got the big picture, let's go deeper. Here's how AI is typically categorized by experts and researchers.</p>

            <h3 className="fw-bold section-headline-gold">‚úÖ <strong>Narrow AI</strong> (a.k.a. Weak AI)</h3>
            
            <p>These systems are highly competent ‚Äî just not flexible. They:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Excel at one job (e.g. recommending products, recognizing speech)</li>
              <li>Can't adapt to new tasks without being retrained</li>
              <li>Are everywhere in the real world</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Examples:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Conversational AI</strong> (chatbots, voice assistants)</li>
              <li><strong>Image recognition</strong> (used in phones, hospitals, airports)</li>
              <li><strong>Recommendation engines</strong> (Amazon, Spotify, Netflix)</li>
              <li><strong>Autonomous driving systems</strong></li>
            </ul>
            
            <div className="card purple-box knowledge-card mb-4">
              <p className="mb-0"><em>Think of Narrow AI as a really smart assistant who's great at their one job ‚Äî but completely lost outside of it.</em></p>
            </div>

            <h4 className="fw-bold">Two Key Types Within Narrow AI:</h4>
            
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Reactive Machines</strong>: These respond to inputs in real time but don't learn or remember. (Like IBM's Deep Blue chess computer.)</li>
              <li><strong>Limited Memory Systems</strong>: These use past data to inform decisions. (Like a self-driving car learning from traffic patterns.)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="fw-bold section-headline-gold">üß† <strong>General AI</strong> (a.k.a. Strong AI or AGI)</h3>
            
            <p>This is where machines get <em>really</em> human-like ‚Äî in theory.</p>
            
            <p>A <strong>General AI</strong> system would:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Reason, learn, and understand the world like a person</li>
              <li>Solve unfamiliar problems without retraining</li>
              <li>Move fluidly between tasks (e.g., do your taxes <em>and</em> write a poem)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The catch? It doesn't exist yet.</p>
            
            <p>We don't know how to build it, how long it'll take, or even whether it's a good idea.</p>
            
            <p>Researchers disagree:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Some believe AGI is 20‚Äì30 years away.</li>
              <li>Others think it may never happen.</li>
              <li>Meanwhile, ethicists warn it could pose serious risks if we're not careful.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div className="card golden-box knowledge-card mb-4">
              <p className="mb-0"><em>General AI is the "holy grail" of AI ‚Äî fascinating, powerful, and very much theoretical.</em></p>
            </div>

            <h3 className="fw-bold section-headline-gold">ü§Ø <strong>Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)</strong></h3>
            
            <p>This one lives in the far-off world of sci-fi and speculation.</p>
            
            <p>ASI would:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Surpass <em>all</em> human intelligence</li>
              <li>Be better than us at creativity, strategy, empathy ‚Äî everything</li>
              <li>Potentially reshape the planet (for better or worse)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>There are <strong>no real examples</strong> of ASI. It's mostly discussed in philosophy, futurism, and apocalyptic movies.</p>

            <h2 id="other-classifications" className="fw-bold section-headline-blue">üí¨ What About Other Classifications?</h2>
            
            <p>Some researchers also divide AI based on how it <em>functions</em>:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Theory of Mind AI</strong>: Hypothetical AI that understands emotions and beliefs (still science fiction)</li>
              <li><strong>Self-Aware AI</strong>: Hypothetical conscious machines (even <em>more</em> science fiction)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Others focus on <strong>technology</strong> types:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Rule-based systems</li>
              <li>Machine learning systems</li>
              <li>Deep learning systems</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>But those are more about <em>how</em> the AI works, not <em>what kind</em> it is.</p>

            <h2 id="case-study" className="fw-bold section-headline-green">üõ†Ô∏è Case Study: Conversational AI in Action</h2>
            
            <p>Let's say you run a business and install a <strong>chatbot</strong> on your website. That bot can:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Answer common customer questions</li>
              <li>Help visitors find the right product</li>
              <li>Process simple orders or lead people to your team</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Behind the scenes, this Conversational AI might use:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</strong> to understand inputs</li>
              <li><strong>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</strong> to pull relevant info from your documents</li>
              <li><strong>Machine learning models</strong> to improve responses over time</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>It's Narrow AI ‚Äî but <strong>highly valuable</strong>. You get speed, scale, and 24/7 support ‚Äî without extra headcount.</p>
