<p>Off-the-shelf bots might say "Hi, how can I help?" But they're not trained on your workflows, your tone, your business logic, or your privacy constraints. They don't <strong>think like your team</strong>. And they definitely don't scale when things get serious.</p>
            
            <p>That's why people turn to me.</p>
            
            <p>I'm <strong>Adam Matthew Steinberger</strong>, a senior software engineering consultant with 12+ years of backend, AI, and infrastructure experience. I build GPT-powered chatbots that are trained on your data, speak in your voice, and integrate with the systems you already use.</p>
            
            <p>No fluff. No lock-in. Just fast, reliable, <strong>tailored AI</strong>—ready to go.</p>

            <h2 id="what-i-do" className="fw-bold section-headline-blue">🧠 What Do I Actually Do?</h2>
            
            <p><strong>I don't build templates. I build tools.</strong></p>
            
            <p>Tools that automate, persuade, answer, qualify, convert, and support. Here's what you get when we work together:</p>

            <h3 id="custom-training" className="fw-bold section-headline-gold">🔧 Custom GPT Training</h3>
            
            <p>Trained on your docs, tone, workflows, and goals. Whether it's onboarding, support, lead capture, or internal knowledge—your chatbot actually knows your business.</p>

            <h3 id="backend" className="fw-bold section-headline-green">🧱 Backend Engineering</h3>
            
            <p>I build the pipes behind the bot: APIs, databases, automations, authentication, integrations. This isn't "no-code." It's <strong>real code</strong>, done cleanly.</p>

            <h3 id="privacy" className="fw-bold section-headline-blue">🔐 Privacy-First Infrastructure</h3>
            
            <p>No sending your data to third parties. I can host models on <strong>your own servers</strong> or cloud infrastructure, encrypted and secured. Ideal for law firms, banks, and anyone sick of Big Tech overreach.</p>

            <h3 id="ai-workflows" className="fw-bold section-headline-gold">🤖 Advanced AI Workflows</h3>
            
            <p>Need RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)? Done. Want semantic validation to prevent hallucinations? Easy. Want to use Mistral, vLLM, and LangChain? I already do.</p>

            <h3 id="deployment" className="fw-bold section-headline-green">📈 Deployment That Just Works</h3>
            
            <p>Slack? Website widget? Internal portal? CRM integration? My bots go where you need them. I ship Dockerized, scalable systems with observability and support baked in.</p>

            <h2 id="results" className="fw-bold section-headline-blue">⚡ Real Results. Real Fast.</h2>
            
            <p>Here's what my clients have achieved:</p>

            <p>You could try a dev shop. Or some prompt hacker from Reddit.</p>
            
            <p>But if you want:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>A <strong>senior engineer</strong> who gets enterprise architecture</li>
              <li>A <strong>privacy advocate</strong> who respects your data boundaries</li>
              <li>A <strong>consultant</strong> who listens first and ships fast</li>
              <li>A <strong>systems thinker</strong> who designs for scale, not show</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Then I'm your guy.</p>
            
            <p>And I won't just tell you what I can do. I'll <strong>show you</strong>, live, anytime:</p>

            </div>
            
            <p>That's a bot I built to represent me. It's trained on my site, my docs, my tone. You're talking to me—just in AI form. Imagine what that kind of tool could do for <strong>you</strong>.</p>
