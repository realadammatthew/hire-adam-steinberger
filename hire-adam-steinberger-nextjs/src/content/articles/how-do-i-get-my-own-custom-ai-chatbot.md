Off-the-shelf bots might say "Hi, how can I help?" But they're not trained on your workflows, your tone, your business logic, or your privacy constraints. They don't **think like your team**. And they definitely don't scale when things get serious.That's why people turn to me.I'm **Adam Matthew Steinberger**, a senior software engineering consultant with 12+ years of backend, AI, and infrastructure experience. I build GPT-powered chatbots that are trained on your data, speak in your voice, and integrate with the systems you already use.No fluff. No lock-in. Just fast, reliable, **tailored AI**—ready to go.## 🧠 What Do I Actually Do?**I don't build templates. I build tools.**Tools that automate, persuade, answer, qualify, convert, and support. Here's what you get when we work together:### 🔧 Custom GPT TrainingTrained on your docs, tone, workflows, and goals. Whether it's onboarding, support, lead capture, or internal knowledge—your chatbot actually knows your business.### 🧱 Backend EngineeringI build the pipes behind the bot: APIs, databases, automations, authentication, integrations. This isn't "no-code." It's **real code**, done cleanly.### 🔐 Privacy-First InfrastructureNo sending your data to third parties. I can host models on **your own servers** or cloud infrastructure, encrypted and secured. Ideal for law firms, banks, and anyone sick of Big Tech overreach.### 🤖 Advanced AI WorkflowsNeed RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)? Done. Want semantic validation to prevent hallucinations? Easy. Want to use Mistral, vLLM, and LangChain? I already do.### 📈 Deployment That Just WorksSlack? Website widget? Internal portal? CRM integration? My bots go where you need them. I ship Dockerized, scalable systems with observability and support baked in.## ⚡ Real Results.
