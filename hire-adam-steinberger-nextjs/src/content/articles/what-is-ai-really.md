<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence is one of those terms we hear everywhere</strong> ‚Äî on news headlines, in product pitches, and maybe even in your latest smartphone update. But despite all the buzz, many people aren't quite sure what AI actually <em>is</em>. Is it a thinking machine? A robot army? A superintelligent overlord? Or just a fancy calculator?</p>

            <p>Let's cut through the noise.</p>

            <h2 id="everyday-ai" className="fw-bold section-headline-blue">ü§ñ The Everyday Meaning of AI</h2>
            
            <p>At its core, <strong>AI simply means machines doing things we normally associate with human intelligence</strong>. That could be recognizing your face in a photo, suggesting your next movie, helping you navigate traffic, or chatting with you online.</p>
            
            <p>A good rule of thumb:</p>
            
            <div className="knowledge-card-enhanced">
              <p><em>If a computer is doing something that would normally require a human brain ‚Äî like learning, planning, or solving problems ‚Äî it's probably using some form of AI.</em></p>
            </div>
            
            <p>You don't need to imagine a robot with feelings. Most AI today doesn't "think" like humans. Instead, it <em>mimics</em> smart behavior using code and math.</p>
            
            <p>For example:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Your email spam filter "learns" what junk looks like.</li>
              <li>Siri "understands" your question and gives a relevant response.</li>
              <li>Netflix "guesses" what you'd like to watch next.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>They're not conscious ‚Äî just well-trained at specific tasks.</p>

            <h2 id="what-is-ai" className="fw-bold section-headline-gold">üîç So, What <em>Is</em> AI?</h2>
            
            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field within computer science focused on building <strong>systems that can simulate aspects of human intelligence</strong>. This includes tasks like:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Learning from data</li>
              <li>Making decisions</li>
              <li>Understanding language</li>
              <li>Recognizing images</li>
              <li>Planning and reasoning</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>More formally, AI is often defined as:</p>
            
            <div className="quote-card">
              <blockquote>"The capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior."</blockquote>
            </div>
            
            <p>Or, in the words of the field's founder, <strong>John McCarthy</strong>, it's:</p>
            
            <div className="quote-card">
              <blockquote>"The science and engineering of making intelligent machines."</blockquote>
            </div>
            
            <p>But that definition is broad, and intentionally so ‚Äî because AI itself covers a huge range of technologies.</p>

            <h2 id="four-ways" className="fw-bold section-headline-green">üß† Four Ways People Think About AI</h2>
            
            <p>According to researchers <strong>Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig</strong>, there are four main ways AI has been defined:</p>
            
            <div className="row g-4 mb-4">
              <div className="col-md-6">
                <div className="grid-card">
                  <h5><i className="fas fa-brain"></i> Thinking Humanly</h5>
                  <p>Mimicking how humans think (cognitive modeling)</p>
                </div>
              </div>
              <div className="col-md-6">
                <div className="grid-card">
                  <h5><i className="fas fa-user"></i> Acting Humanly</h5>
                  <p>Behaving like a person (e.g., passing the Turing Test)</p>
                </div>
              </div>
              <div className="col-md-6">
                <div className="grid-card">
                  <h5><i className="fas fa-cogs"></i> Thinking Rationally</h5>
                  <p>Using logic to reason correctly</p>
                </div>
              </div>
              <div className="col-md-6">
                <div className="grid-card">
                  <h5><i className="fas fa-target"></i> Acting Rationally</h5>
                  <p>Choosing actions that maximize outcomes</p>
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
            
            <p>Most AI systems today aim to <em>act rationally</em>. That means they aren't trying to be human ‚Äî just to achieve goals effectively.</p>

            <h2 id="history" className="fw-bold section-headline-blue">‚è≥ A Brief History of AI</h2>
            
            <p>AI has been around longer than you might think. It was born at a 1956 workshop at Dartmouth College, where scientists gathered to explore how machines could "think."</p>
            
            <p>There have been cycles of hype and disappointment over the decades:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>In the 1960s, people thought AI would solve everything by 1980.</li>
              <li>In the 1970s and 80s, progress slowed ‚Äî leading to "AI winters."</li>
              <li>In the 2010s, <strong>deep learning</strong> and cheap GPUs sparked an explosion in progress.</li>
              <li>In 2020, tools like <strong>GPT-3</strong> and <strong>ChatGPT</strong> made AI feel <em>real</em> to the public.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Today, AI powers everything from Tesla's self-driving features to fraud detection in your bank.</p>

            <h2 id="myths" className="fw-bold section-headline-gold">üö´ Common AI Myths (and Truths)</h2>
            
            <p>Let's clear up a few misconceptions that can get in the way of meaningful conversations:</p>
            
            <div className="myth-card">
              <h5><i className="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Myth 1: "AI is sentient."</h5>
              <p><strong>Truth:</strong> Nope. Current AI systems don't have emotions, self-awareness, or consciousness.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div className="myth-card">
              <h5><i className="fas fa-brain"></i> Myth 2: "AI equals machine learning."</h5>
              <p><strong>Truth:</strong> Machine learning is just <em>one</em> technique under the AI umbrella. There are others ‚Äî like expert systems and symbolic logic.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div className="myth-card">
              <h5><i className="fas fa-user"></i> Myth 3: "AI thinks like a human."</h5>
              <p><strong>Truth:</strong> AI mimics intelligent <em>behavior</em>, not thought. It finds patterns, not meaning.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div className="myth-card">
              <h5><i className="fas fa-briefcase"></i> Myth 4: "AI will take all our jobs."</h5>
              <p><strong>Truth:</strong> AI may replace some roles but will also create new ones. Think of it more like electricity ‚Äî a general tool that reshapes how work is done.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div className="myth-card">
              <h5><i className="fas fa-building"></i> Myth 5: "Only big companies can use AI."</h5>
              <p><strong>Truth:</strong> False. Open-source tools, APIs, and platforms have made AI more accessible than ever. Small businesses use AI to automate tasks, generate content, and support customers ‚Äî often affordably.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Large amounts of <strong>data</strong></li>
              <li>Algorithms that <strong>learn</strong> patterns</li>
