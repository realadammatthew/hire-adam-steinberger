## LoRA Fine-Tuning Expertise

Efficient model adaptation using parameter-efficient methods:

* **PEFT Frameworks:** Hugging Face PEFT with LoRA, QLoRA, and AdaLoRA
* **Configuration Tuning:** Alpha scaling, dropout setting, rank control, and module targeting
* **Training Optimization:** Mixed precision, gradient checkpointing, and multi-GPU DDP
* **Adapter Composition:** Multi-task systems using adapter merging and task routing
* **Quantized Inference:** Efficient model deployment with QLoRA and quantization support
* **Monitoring Tools:** LoRA inference performance metrics, latency analysis, model versioning

---

## Implementation Examples

* **QLoRA Integration:** Fine-tune LLMs on commodity GPUs using quantized training flows
* **Multi-Task Model:** Compose multiple LoRA adapters for cross-domain applications
* **Inference Optimization:** Use quantized adapters for fast, low-memory API serving
* **Adapter Merging:** Combine domain-specific adapters into a single production model
* **Custom DSL Adapter:** LoRA fine-tuning for internal documentation and structured data

---

## Fine-Tuning Process

1. **Model Analysis**
   Identify target modules, available compute, and desired adaptation outcomes

2. **Training Pipeline**
   Build training loop, apply LoRA configuration, and run optimized training

3. **Deployment & Optimization**
   Merge adapters, quantize, and deploy to production with latency monitoring
