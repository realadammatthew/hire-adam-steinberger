## RAG Expertise

Scalable, secure retrieval systems that connect LLMs to your real-world data:

* **Vector Databases:** Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma, Qdrant, Milvus, or custom solutions
* **Semantic Retrieval:** Dense and hybrid search, OpenAI or sentence-transformer embeddings
* **RAG Pipelines:** LangChain, LlamaIndex, or custom frameworks with advanced context control
* **Context Engineering:** Prompt injection, summarization, relevance weighting, chunk fusion
* **Latency Optimization:** Caching, async batching, low-latency embedding + retrieval workflows
* **Production Systems:** API endpoints, usage monitoring, logging, error handling, scale tuning

---

## Implementation Examples

* **Hybrid RAG Search:** Dense + sparse retrieval using BM25, embedding, and re-ranking
* **Conversational RAG:** Multi-turn chat with memory-aware retrieval
* **Query Expansion:** Synonym and keyword expansion for more intelligent recall
* **Real-Time RAG:** Dynamic document updates with live indexing
* **Chunk Optimization:** Structured chunking with scoring and semantic context
* **RAG on PDFs:** Structured processing of PDF, DOCX, and HTML files with embeddings

## RAG Development Process

1. **Document Processing**
   Prepare and chunk documents, generate embeddings, and populate your vector DB

2. **Retrieval Pipeline Design**
   Implement fast, relevant search with hybrid logic, filtering, and scoring

3. **Context Injection & Generation**
   Combine top results with optimized prompts and context window strategies

4. **Deployment & Optimization**
   API-based access, latency tuning, monitoring, and scaling strategy
