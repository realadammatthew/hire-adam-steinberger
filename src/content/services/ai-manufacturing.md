# Smarter Manufacturing with AI in the Triangle Area

## Built for Industrial Efficiency, Safety & Growth

From smart factories to lean operations, I develop AI systems that help manufacturers optimize processes, minimize downtime, and ensure consistent product quality.

### Manufacturing AI Use Cases

- **Automotive Manufacturing:** Assembly optimization, predictive maintenance, and supplier tracking  
- **Electronics Manufacturing:** Component testing, quality inspection, and downtime reduction  
- **Pharmaceuticals:** Regulatory compliance, quality tracking, and batch analysis  
- **Food & Beverage:** Real-time production tracking, safety enforcement, and waste reduction  
- **Textiles:** Fabric inspection, color accuracy, and supply chain visibility  
- **Heavy Industry:** Equipment usage tracking, hazard detection, and energy efficiency  

### Benefits for Manufacturers

- 30% increase in equipment uptime  
- 50% defect reduction from automated inspections  
- 40% boost in supply chain performance  
- 25% increase in overall production output  
- 60% stronger safety enforcement with hazard detection  
- 35% reduction in operational costs  
- 20% improvement in energy efficiency  

### How It Works

1. **Assessment:** Identify key opportunities across your operations for AI automation  
2. **Development:** Build custom predictive maintenance, supply chain, or QC tools  
3. **Integration:** Connect AI with ERP systems, sensors, databases, or MES software  
4. **Deployment:** Launch solutions with full team training and performance monitoring  

### Manufacturing AI Pricing

Custom pricing based on facility size and AI implementation complexity:

- **Small Manufacturers:** $25K–60K  
- **Mid-Sized Facilities:** $60K–150K  
- **Large Manufacturing Sites:** $150K–400K+  
- **Multi-Site Operations:** $300K–800K+  
- **Specialized Use Cases:** $20K–50K  

### Industrial Security & Compliance

All AI systems are built with secure data pipelines, audit logging, and industrial-grade privacy protections.
