## Context Engineering Technical Expertise

I design and deploy context systems that scale with your AI stack:

- **Dynamic Context Management:** Sliding window logic, real-time input optimization, adaptive sizing
- **Token Compression:** Summarization, clustering, entity abstraction, token reduction pipelines
- **Context Prioritization:** Relevance scoring, decay models, heuristic & learned selection models
- **Memory Systems:** Vector DBs, hybrid memory, structured & unstructured long-term memory
- **Performance Optimization:** Load balancing, caching strategies, asynchronous streaming
- **Monitoring & Debugging:** Context flow tracking, injection auditing, context token analysis
- **Production Frameworks:** Custom context pipelines with API-based context formatting and fallback control

---

## Implementation Examples

- **Sliding Window Engine:** Dynamically resize input tokens based on recency, relevance, and topic decay
- **Long-Term Memory Stack:** Multi-source memory system with structured storage and semantic retrieval
- **Compression-as-a-Service:** Middleware summarizer compressing token-heavy inputs into abstracted embeddings
- **Context Ranking Algorithm:** Learn-to-rank model for choosing relevant chat history in real-time
- **Embedded Context Diagnostics:** Monitor token usage, failure patterns, and LLM context collapse in production
- **Latency Optimization:** Pre-fetching and smart caching for sub-100ms API context injection speeds

## Context Engineering Process

1. **Context Analysis**  
   Understand context volume, access patterns, and performance goals.

2. **Design Phase**  
   Develop architecture with compression, prioritization, and memory strategies.

3. **Optimization & Deployment**  
   Tune latency, validate performance, and monitor results in real-time production systems.
