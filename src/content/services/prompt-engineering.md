## Prompt Engineering Expertise

Advanced prompt design and testing for production-grade LLM use:

- **Prompt Design:** Role definition, formatting, structured outputs, tone calibration
- **Few-Shot Examples:** Example curation, ordering effects, token efficiency
- **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:** Structured reasoning for multi-step tasks and logical flows
- **Prompt Evaluation:** A/B testing, outcome consistency, performance metrics
- **Security Hardening:** Prompt injection prevention, edge case testing, robustness evaluation
- **Prompt Templates:** Versioned prompt libraries with inputs/outputs for testing and reuse

---

## Implementation Examples

- **Complex Reasoning Prompts:** Chain-of-thought architecture for math, logic, and planning tasks
- **Few-Shot Summarization:** Use few-shot prompts to guide narrative and tone for summaries
- **Conversational Memory:** Design prompts that simulate memory and long-context recall
- **Secure Prompts:** Adversarial prompt resistance and input sanitization for LLM safety
- **Multi-Turn Templates:** Structured input prompts for customer service chatbots
