## vLLM Technical Expertise

I specialize in scalable, performance-tuned vLLM API systems:

* **vLLM Core:** PagedAttention, GPU memory optimization, server performance tuning
* **Inference Optimization:** Throughput tuning, latency reduction, load handling
* **Caching Systems:** KV cache control, request deduplication, memory-efficient storage
* **Dynamic Batching:** Queued request processing, adaptive batch sizes, response grouping
* **API Design:** Secure endpoints, auth layers, WebSocket support, async endpoints
* **Production Infrastructure:** Docker, Kubernetes, horizontal scaling, health checks
* **Monitoring & Observability:** Prometheus/Grafana metrics, request tracing, logs, and error alerts

---

## vLLM Implementation Examples

* **High-Throughput APIs:** Concurrent inference with GPU batching and low-latency caching
* **Dynamic Batching Engine:** Real-time batching for chat and API endpoints with smart queuing
* **Memory-Aware Serving:** Use of PagedAttention for large model serving within memory limits
* **Cloud-Native Deployment:** Scalable vLLM clusters deployed via Kubernetes with autoscaling
* **Multi-Model Orchestration:** Route requests across multiple vLLM models with version control
* **API Access Layer:** REST/GraphQL APIs with integrated auth and rate limiting

---

## Development Process

1. **Model & Infra Analysis**
   Evaluate models, memory needs, and infrastructure for vLLM deployment.

2. **Server & API Design**
   Build vLLM server stack with API endpoints, caching, batching, and routing logic.

3. **Production Deployment**
   Deploy into containerized environments with full monitoring and scaling setup.
