## TL;DR
- **AGI = human-level AI across domains.**  
- Benefits: transformative innovation, massive productivity.  
- Risks: existential safety, disruption, inequality.  
- 2025 = hype is loud, but **narrow AI still rules the enterprise.**

## Why This Matters Now

- OpenAI + Anthropic hinting at AGI roadmaps.  
- Researchers debating AGI timelines (5 years vs never).  
- Enterprises wondering how to prepare.  

---

## Business Implications

- **Short Term**: No AGI yet—focus on **narrow, practical AI.**  
- **Medium Term**: Prepare governance + flexibility.  
- **Long Term**: AGI could reshape entire industries.

## Mini Case Story: Hype vs Reality

An enterprise delayed automation waiting for AGI.  
- Lost competitive ground to rivals using **today’s narrow AI.**  
- Lesson: **don’t wait—act now.**

## The Debate: Imminent vs Decades Away

- **Pro**: Some predict AGI within this decade.  
- **Con**: Others argue AGI may never be possible.  
- **Prediction**: 2025–2030 = narrow AI dominance, AGI still speculative.

## Action Plan

1. Focus on **current AI ROI, not AGI hype.**  
2. Build governance flexible enough for future tech.  
3. Monitor AGI developments for **strategic pivots.**  

---

## Path Forward

AGI may be the holy grail—but the real money today is in **applied, narrow AI.**
