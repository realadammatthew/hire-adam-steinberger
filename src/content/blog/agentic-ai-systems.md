## Why This Matters Now

- OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta are racing to build agent frameworks.  
- LangGraph, AutoGen, and CrewAI are maturing fast.  
- Enterprises want more than copilots → they want **agents that execute end-to-end tasks**.  

This isn’t hype anymore—2025 is the year **agents leave the lab and hit production.**
