## TL;DR
- **On-device AI** runs models directly on laptops, phones, or IoT devices—no cloud dependency.  
- The rise of NPUs (Apple, Qualcomm, AMD, Intel) makes local AI feasible at scale.  
- Benefits: **privacy, speed, lower cloud costs**.  
- Challenges: limited model sizes, device fragmentation, IT governance.  
- Future: **hybrid AI**—splitting workloads between local devices and the cloud.

## Why the Buzz Now?

- **Apple Intelligence** brought on-device AI to iOS and macOS.  
- Microsoft’s **Copilot+ PCs** require NPUs for local AI workloads.  
- Enterprises worry about **data leaks** from cloud LLMs and want local control.  

The industry is swinging back toward **edge-first computing**.

## Key Business Applications

- **Healthcare**: Patient data processed locally to ensure HIPAA compliance.  
- **Finance**: Risk models run on secure devices, not external servers.  
- **Retail**: AI kiosks and POS systems analyze data on-site.  
- **Field Work**: Edge devices support technicians without internet connectivity.

## Case Study: Financial Compliance

A bank shifted certain fraud detection tasks to on-device AI for compliance.  

- Reduced regulatory exposure  
- Faster transaction analysis  
- Lowered reliance on third-party cloud APIs  

---

## Pros and Cons

**Pros**  
- Strong privacy and compliance  
- Reduced latency  
- Cost savings on API calls  

**Cons**  
- Limited to smaller models  
- Fragmented hardware landscape  
- Requires IT policy adjustments  

---

## Action Plan

1. Identify workloads that need **privacy + low latency**.  
2. Deploy on-device AI pilots on Copilot+ PCs or Apple Intelligence devices.  
3. Build a **hybrid strategy**: local inference + cloud-heavy training.  
4. Update IT governance for device-based AI workloads.
