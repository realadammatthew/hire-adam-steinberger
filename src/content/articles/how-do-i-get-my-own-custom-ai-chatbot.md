👋 **Let's Start Simple.** Imagine hiring someone to build your house. You could get a cheap prefab. But if you want it to match your lifestyle, grow with your needs, and stand for years—you'd hire an architect who knows what they're doing. Building a custom AI chatbot is no different.

Off-the-shelf bots might say "Hi, how can I help?" But they're not trained on your workflows, your tone, your business logic, or your privacy constraints. They don't think like your team. And they definitely don't scale when things get serious.

That's why people turn to me.

I'm Adam Matthew Steinberger, a Staff Software Engineer and AI Solutions Architect with 12+ years of backend, AI, and infrastructure experience. I build GPT-powered chatbots that are trained on your data, speak in your voice, and integrate with the systems you already use.

No fluff. No lock-in. Just fast, reliable, tailored AI—ready to go.

## 🧠 What Do I Actually Do?

I don't build templates. I build tools.

Tools that automate, persuade, answer, qualify, convert, and support. Here's what you get when we work together:

### 🔧 Custom GPT Training

Trained on your docs, tone, workflows, and goals. Whether it's onboarding, support, lead capture, or internal knowledge—your chatbot actually knows your business.

### 🧱 Backend Engineering

I build the pipes behind the bot: APIs, databases, automations, authentication, integrations. This isn't "no-code." It's real code, done cleanly.

### 🔐 Privacy-First Infrastructure

No sending your data to third parties. I can host models on your own servers or cloud infrastructure, encrypted and secured. Ideal for law firms, banks, and anyone sick of Big Tech overreach.

### 🤖 Advanced AI Workflows

Need RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)? Done. Want semantic validation to prevent hallucinations? Easy. Want to use Mistral, vLLM, and LangChain? I already do.

### 📈 Deployment That Just Works

Slack? Website widget? Internal portal? CRM integration? My bots go where you need them. I ship Dockerized, scalable systems with observability and support baked in.

## ⚡ Real Results. Real Fast.

Here's what my clients have achieved:

- 🏠 **Real estate platform:** Reduced support tickets by 40%, tripled lead capture.
- 🏛️ **Law firm intake bot:** Automated onboarding, CRM-integrated, 24/7 availability.
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Nonprofit:** Saved 30+ hours/month by handling grant-related FAQs.
- 🧑‍💼 **Internal team GPT:** Enabled staff to instantly query internal docs without asking IT.
- 🔐 **Privacy-conscious org:** Deployed self-hosted LLM with zero third-party data exposure.

Whether it's a $5K starter package or a $100K+ enterprise rollout, I build bots that deliver results—not excuses.

### Proven Results

From $5K starter packages to $100K+ enterprise rollouts, I build bots that deliver measurable results—40% ticket reduction, 3x lead capture, 30+ hours saved monthly.

## 💡 Why Not Just Use ChatGPT or Tidio?

Because you're not trying to play with AI—you're trying to win with it.

Generic platforms:

- ❌ Can't access your data
- ❌ Don't sound like your brand
- ❌ Can't integrate with your systems
- ❌ Expose your data to vendors
- ❌ Aren't extensible when your needs grow

I give you:

- ✅ Full ownership
- ✅ Full customization
- ✅ Full integration
- ✅ Full security
- ✅ A partner who speaks fluent backend, AI, and business

## 🎯 Why Me?

You could try a dev shop. Or some prompt hacker from Reddit.

But if you want:

- A staff software engineer who gets enterprise architecture
- A privacy advocate who respects your data boundaries
- A contributor who listens first and ships fast
- A systems thinker who designs for scale, not show

Then I'm your guy.

And I won't just tell you what I can do. I'll show you, live, anytime:

That's a bot I built to represent me. It's trained on my site, my docs, my tone. You're talking to me—just in AI form. Imagine what that kind of tool could do for you.

## 🧠 TL;DR

- 🛠️ I build custom GPT bots, not plug-and-play fluff.
- 🧠 I handle engineering, integration, security, and AI alignment.
- 🔐 Your data stays private, hosted where you want it.
- ⚡ I move fast, ship reliably, and support what I build.
- 💬 Schedule a call. I'll show you how this applies to your business.
