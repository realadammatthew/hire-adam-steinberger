  - Nginx
duration: 30 days
status: completed
challenge: A non-profit organization needed an AI chatbot to help answer questions about their services and programs, but they had strict data privacy requirements. They couldn't use cloud-based AI services due to sensitive donor and recipient information that needed to remain completely private and secure.
solution: I developed a completely self-hosted RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot using Mistral-7B model running on their own infrastructure. The system processes all data locally with no external API calls, ensuring complete data privacy while providing intelligent responses to user queries.
results: Successfully deployed a privacy-compliant AI chatbot that handles 200+ queries daily with 95% accuracy. Zero data leaves their infrastructure, meeting strict privacy requirements while reducing staff workload by 60% on routine inquiries.
techStack: Built with Python using FastAPI for the backend, Mistral-7B model for language processing, ChromaDB for vector storage, and Docker for containerization. Frontend implemented with vanilla JavaScript for lightweight performance.
architecture: Implemented a self-contained RAG architecture with local document embedding, vector similarity search, and context-aware response generation. All components run on-premises with no external dependencies.
lessons: This project highlighted the importance of balancing AI capabilities with privacy requirements. Self-hosted solutions require careful resource management but provide unmatched data security for sensitive organizations.

# Privacy-First RAG Chatbot

## Project Overview

A 30-day project to develop a completely self-hosted RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot for a non-profit organization with strict data privacy requirements. The solution ensures zero data exposure to external services while maintaining high-quality AI responses.

## The Challenge

The non-profit faced several critical requirements:

- **Absolute Data Privacy**: Sensitive donor and recipient information could not leave their infrastructure
- **No Cloud Dependencies**: Could not use external AI services like OpenAI or Claude
- **Limited Resources**: Non-profit budget constraints required cost-effective solutions
- **Staff Efficiency**: Needed to reduce repetitive inquiries to overworked staff
- **Compliance**: Had to meet strict regulatory requirements for data handling

## Technical Solution

### Self-Hosted RAG Architecture
I designed a completely isolated system that processes all data locally:

- **Local AI Model**: Mistral-7B running on their own hardware
- **Private Vector Database**: ChromaDB for document embeddings
- **Secure API**: FastAPI backend with authentication
- **Containerized Deployment**: Docker for easy management
- **Web Interface**: Lightweight frontend for user interactions

### Technology Stack
- **AI Model**: Mistral-7B (7 billion parameter model)
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI framework
- **Vector Database**: ChromaDB for similarity search
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript with Bootstrap
- **Containerization**: Docker Compose for orchestration
- **Web Server**: Nginx for reverse proxy and SSL

### Key Implementations

#### RAG Pipeline
```python
# Simplified RAG implementation
import chromadb
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

class PrivacyRAGChatbot:
    def __init__(self):
        # Load local embedding model
        self.encoder = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

        # Initialize local vector database
        self.chroma_client = chromadb.PersistentClient(path="./data/chroma")
        self.collection = self.chroma_client.get_or_create_collection("documents")

        # Load Mistral-7B model locally
        self.tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1")
        self.model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
            "mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1",
            torch_dtype=torch.float16,
            device_map="auto"
        )

    async def generate_response(self, query: str) -> str:
        # Embed query
        query_embedding = self.encoder.encode([query])

        # Retrieve relevant documents
        results = self.collection.query(
            query_embeddings=query_embedding,
            n_results=3
        )

        # Generate context-aware response
        context = "\n".join(results['documents'][0])
        prompt = f"Context: {context}\n\nQuestion: {query}\n\nAnswer:"

        inputs = self.tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
        outputs = self.model.generate(**inputs, max_length=512)
        response = self.tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

        return response.split("Answer:")[-1].strip()
```

#### Document Processing
```python
# Document ingestion and embedding
def process_documents(self, documents_path: str):
    for file_path in glob.glob(f"{documents_path}/**/*.txt", recursive=True):
        with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
            content = file.read()

        # Chunk documents for better retrieval
        chunks = self.chunk_text(content, chunk_size=500)

        # Generate embeddings
        embeddings = self.encoder.encode(chunks)

        # Store in local vector database
        self.collection.add(
            embeddings=embeddings.tolist(),
            documents=chunks,
            metadatas=[{"source": file_path}] * len(chunks),
            ids=[f"{file_path}_{i}" for i in range(len(chunks))]
        )
```
